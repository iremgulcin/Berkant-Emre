### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics
The model was evaluated on a separate test set of 1,000 MRI images.



#### Testing Data

<!-- This should link to a Dataset Card if possible. -->
7000 MRI images with 4 different brain tumor type were used. Training dataset was obtained by splitting data randomly.
The whole dataset was given above.

#### Factors
Factors considered in the evaluation include the diversity of tumor types, image quality, and the presence of artifacts.


#### Metrics

<!-- These are the evaluation metrics being used, ideally with a description of why. Decision tresholds, model performance measures -->
Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified images.
Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Metrics to evaluate the model's performance in classifying each tumor type.
Intersection over Union (IoU): A metric to evaluate the localization accuracy of YOLOv5.

### Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, with precision and recall values above 90% for each tumor type. The IoU for tumor localization was 0.85.
